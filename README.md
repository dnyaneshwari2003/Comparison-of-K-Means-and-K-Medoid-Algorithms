#  Comparison of K-Means and K-Medoid Algorithms  


## Overview  
This project involves comparing the performance of the **K-Means** and **K-Medoid** clustering algorithms using the Iris dataset.  



## Objectives  
- Implement and evaluate **K-Means** and **K-Medoid** algorithms.  
- Compare their performance on the Iris dataset based on clustering metrics and visualizations.  



## Dataset  
- **Iris Dataset**: A widely used dataset containing features of iris flowers for clustering tasks.  
Note : you can source this dataset from kaggle
